    <!-- First, I bit off more than I could chew for the week really. So the outcome isn't as pretty as I would 
    have hoped. Missing a lot of detail work, and a couple elements and I had fights for supremacy at the last minute
    and I lost. 
    My project was to try and realistically make a site for holiday activities that people would have a quick reference
    for our entire valley. This is intended to just be an informative page that links to the individual city pages or the 
    event page online. Personally, I wanted to try and approach this as an actual job so I could get an idea of my time constraints
    and skills. Turns out I underestimated by at least two days I would guess. Great lesson for me! So, without further adieu...
    I wanted the home page to stand out from the others, so I sized the cards differently than on the city pages.
    I did try to keep the navbar the same throughout all pages for visual consistency. I also used cards for all the 
    events across the project. Just linking everything so that you can get to a new page in multiple places was more time consuming than I 
    imagined. Finally had to deal with having to double check myself that I included everything on EVERY page. I did my best 
    to use only bootstrap for my components, I did have to add one CSS command of my own to get the result I wanted. I imagine
    if I had more time to tweak things, I would have had a full page by the time I was done. Bootstrap made it pretty simple
    to get close to what I wanted, I am really excited to continue experimenting because there were so many options!
    My biggest issue still remaining is mostly in my photos, trying to get everything evenly sized and in focus will take 
    some practice for sure. All my city pages essentially are the same. I did allow for some open space, just visually
    to show that events could be added or subtracted along the way, just know that was intentional and not an absolute oversight.
    Thats about it for most of the pages. Only other notes will be on submissions page. -->
